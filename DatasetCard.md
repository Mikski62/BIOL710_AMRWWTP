### Dataset Summary

This dataset includes metagenomic data from influent samples collected at a municipal wastewater treatment plant. It documents microbial community structure and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) gene presence, supporting One Health-oriented research. It was created to apply and evaluate the Resistance Persistence Index (RPI) for AMR gene burden. The dataset is in English and formatted for classification and annotation tasks.

### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

- `structured-data-classification`: Enables modeling microbial or AMR gene presence using structured tabular data.
- `other:metagenomic-annotation`: Supports annotation or unsupervised exploration of microbial sequences and AMR gene presence.

### Languages

English (`en`) metadata with Latin taxonomic annotations for microbial taxa.

## Dataset Creation

### Curation Rationale

The dataset was created to evaluate AMR risk using a newly proposed RPI framework and to contribute to wastewater-based surveillance of public health threats.

### Source Data

#### Initial Data Collection and Normalization

Samples were collected, concentrated with Nanotrap particles, DNA-extracted (NucleoMag), and sequenced with Illumina. CZ-ID pipeline was used for bioinformatic analysis.

#### Who are the source language producers?

Microbial taxa in environmental wastewater. Metadata and interpretation by the researchers.

### Annotations

#### Annotation process

CZ-ID and CARD used for computational annotation. Manual curation where appropriate.

#### Who are the annotators?

Annotations were generated computationally and reviewed by the research team, led by Michael Hajkowski.

### Personal and Sensitive Information

No human-identifiable information is present. All data are derived from anonymized environmental sampling.

## Considerations for Using the Data

### Social Impact of Dataset

Helps track AMR trends at a community level through environmental surveillance. Supports public health interventions via the One Health framework.

### Discussion of Biases

May be biased by database limitations or sequencing method bias. Small sample size also limits generalization.

### Other Known Limitations

Limited sample size and lack of temporal scope. Future work should include seasonal variation.
