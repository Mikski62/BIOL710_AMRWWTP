Abstract:
With the evolution and emergence of novel bacterial and viral pathogens, and with antimicrobial resistance (AMR) expected to contribute to 39 million deaths between 2025 and 2050, it is essential to identify and classify these possible threats to better understand their impacts on human and environmental health. Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTPs) play a major role in disseminating AMR, further circulating their infectivity range. Traditional wastewater-based epidemiology methods rely on inefficient microbial concentration technologies and targeted sequencing methods, limiting the comprehensive detection of microorganisms and AMR genes. Combining Nanotrap-based concentration technologies with next-generation sequencing (NGS) provides enhanced species resolution and allows for AMR detection. While general AMR detection is important in mitigating AMR threats, it is crucial to assess associated risk, as not all AMRs pose the same level of threat. The existing AMR risk assessment framework evaluates AMR risk by mobility, associated environment, and pathogenicity, overlooking seasonal persistence as a vital element to AMR risk. It is unclear how bacterial diversity and AMR dissemination trends change over seasons and how AMR seasonal persistence affects AMR risk classification. Aligning with the CDCâ€™s One Health directive, this project bridges gaps in our understanding of WWTP impacts on AMR dissemination patterns and risk.

To address these gaps, I 1) assessed the diversity of bacterial taxa between two seasons, 2) characterized the seasonal variation of AMR gene prevalence, and 3) compared AMR risk between the AMR risk rank framework (Zhang et al., 2021) and the Resistance Persistence Index (RPI) framework using influent samples from a WWTP. This study elucidated the presence of bacterial shedding and AMR dissemination patterns in influent wastewater over two seasons, summer and winter. Integrating persistence into the AMR risk framework shifted perceived risk levels for AMR, showing a need for integrating seasonal stability as a risk contribution.
